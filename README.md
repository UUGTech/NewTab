This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Summary
[This static page](https://uugtech.github.io/NewTab) created by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is intended to replace chrome's new tab page.
This is because [vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium), a wonderful chrome extension, does not work on the __new tab page__.
- The page opened by `t` in vimium can be set to this page in the vimium settings.
- The page that opens when chrome starts up can also be changed to this page from the chrome settings.

This will allow you to live a comfortable vimium life!

This page uses [Catppuccin Theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin), a fantastic color theme, and its wallpaper.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
